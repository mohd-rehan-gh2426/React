# JavaScript – History & Fundamentals

## Introduction

JavaScript is one of the most important programming languages in the world today. It powers modern websites, web applications, servers, mobile apps, desktop software, and more. However, JavaScript did not start this way. Understanding **why JavaScript was created, how it evolved, and how it works today** gives a strong foundation for learning it properly.

This document explains the **complete story of JavaScript**, from its birth in the 1990s to its modern form.

## 1. The Early Web (Before JavaScript)

In the early 1990s:

* Websites were **static**
* Servers stored **HTML files**
* Browsers requested files from servers and displayed them

### Limitations of Early Websites

* No calculations
* No interaction
* No dynamic content
* Every action required a **server request**

Example:

* A calculator website had to send data to the server
* Server calculated the result
* New HTML page was sent back
* Page reloaded every time

This was **slow**, especially with 2G internet speeds.

---

## 2. Netscape Browser

* Most popular browser in the 1990s
* Around **90% market share**
* Founder: **Mark Andreessen**

Netscape realized that:

> The user’s computer has a processor and memory, so it should be able to perform calculations locally.

This idea led to the creation of a **browser-based programming language**.

---

## 3. Birth of JavaScript

### Brendan Eich

* Netscape hired **Brendan Eich**
* Task: Create a programming language that runs inside the browser

### Development

* First version created in **10 days** (1995)

### Name Changes

* Mocha
* LiveScript
* JavaScript

> JavaScript was named after Java only for marketing purposes. It has **no technical relation** to Java.

---

## 4. What JavaScript Solved

JavaScript allowed:

* Calculations in the browser
* No page reloads
* Faster user experience
* Websites to become **interactive**

Examples:

* Form validation
* Calculators
* Dynamic UI updates

This changed the web completely.

---

## 5. Browser Wars & Standardization

### Microsoft Enters

* Internet Explorer launched
* Microsoft created **JScript** (similar but different from JavaScript)

### The Problem

* Different browsers → different languages
* Developers would need to write multiple versions of code

### The Solution: ECMA

* Netscape approached **ECMA** (European Computer Manufacturers Association)
* ECMA created a standard specification

### ECMAScript

* The official standard for JavaScript
* Any language following this standard is called **JavaScript**

---

## 6. ECMAScript Versions

JavaScript evolves through ECMAScript versions:

* ES3
* ES5
* ES6 (Major update)
* ES7 and later

> Core JavaScript remains the same; new features are added over time.

---

## 7. Chrome & V8 Engine (2008)

### Chrome Browser

* Released in 2008
* Introduced the **V8 JavaScript Engine**

### Why V8 Was Important

* JavaScript became much faster
* Used **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation**

After Chrome:

* Firefox → SpiderMonkey
* Other browsers optimized their engines
* Modern browsers became very fast

---

## 8. Node.js – JavaScript Beyond the Browser

### Ryan Dahl

* Took Chrome’s V8 engine
* Ran it outside the browser
* Created **Node.js**

### Result

JavaScript could now run:

* On servers
* On backend systems
* Outside the browser environment

> Same JavaScript, different runtime environment.

---

## 9. Rise of Frameworks & Modern Web

Because JavaScript became fast and powerful:

* AngularJS
* ReactJS
* VueJS

Websites evolved into **web applications**.

### Important Learning Rule

* HTML + CSS + JavaScript = Foundation
* Frameworks come later

> Weak fundamentals lead to long-term problems.

---

## 10. JavaScript: Interpreted or Compiled?

### Interpreted Languages

* Code executed line by line
* Easier error handling
* Slower execution

### Compiled Languages

* Code converted entirely to machine code
* Faster execution
* Errors cause crashes

### Modern JavaScript

* Uses **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation**
* Combination of interpretation and compilation

### Correct Interview Answer

> JavaScript was originally interpreted, but modern JavaScript engines use JIT compilation, so it is neither purely interpreted nor purely compiled.

---

## 11. Key Interview Facts

* Creator of JavaScript: **Brendan Eich**
* Original names: **Mocha**, **LiveScript**
* Browser that introduced JavaScript: **Netscape**
* JavaScript standard: **ECMAScript**
* Chrome engine: **V8**
* Node.js creator: **Ryan Dahl**

---

## Final Summary

JavaScript was created to bring interactivity to static websites, standardized as ECMAScript, optimized by modern engines like V8, and expanded beyond browsers using Node.js. Today, it is one of the most powerful and widely used programming languages in the world.

# JavaScript Ternary Operator (Complete Notes)

---

## 1. What is the Ternary Operator?

The **ternary operator** is a **short and concise alternative to `if-else`**.

- Used for **decision making**
- Returns **one value**
- Written in **one line**
- Very common in real-world JavaScript (frontend, backend, React)

---

## 2. Why is it called Ternary?

Because it works with **three parts**:

```

condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false

````

- `condition` → evaluated to true or false
- `?` → if
- `:` → else

---

## 3. Basic Syntax

```js
condition ? expression1 : expression2
````

### Rule

* If condition is **true** → `expression1` is returned
* If condition is **false** → `expression2` is returned

---

## 4. Simple Example

```js
true ? "Anurag" : 100
```

✔ Output:

```
Anurag
```

```js
false ? "Anurag" : 100
```

✔ Output:

```
100
```

---

## 5. Using a Condition

```js
5 > 2 ? "Yes" : "No"
```

✔ Output:

```
Yes
```

```js
5 > 12 ? "Yes" : "No"
```

✔ Output:

```
No
```

---

## 6. Storing Result in a Variable

```js
const username = true ? "Anurag" : "Procoder";
```

* Condition is true
* `username` gets `"Anurag"`

```js
const username = false ? "Anurag" : "Procoder";
```

* Condition is false
* `username` gets `"Procoder"`

📌 **Ternary always returns a value**

---

## 7. Real-World Example: Gender (He / She)

### Problem

Display:

* `"He is a college student"` for male
* `"She is a college student"` for female

---

### Step 1: Gender Variable

```js
const gender = "F";
```

---

### Step 2: Template Literal with Ternary

```js
const userMessage =
  `${gender === "F" ? "She" : "He"} is a college student`;
```

✔ Output:

```
She is a college student
```

---

## 8. Why Template Literals?

Ternary returns a value, and template literals allow inserting values inside strings.

```js
`${condition ? value1 : value2}`
```

Used when part of a sentence depends on a condition.

---

## 9. Case Sensitivity Issue

JavaScript is **case-sensitive**.

```js
"F" !== "f"
```

So this fails:

```js
gender === "F"
```

If gender is `"f"`.

---

## 10. Solution: Normalize Using `toLowerCase()`

```js
const userMessage =
  `${gender.toLowerCase() === "f" ? "She" : "He"} is a college student`;
```

✔ Works for `"F"` and `"f"`
✔ Best practice in real projects

---

## 11. Truthy and Falsy Values

Ternary **does NOT require only true/false**.

It works on **truthy** and **falsy** values.

---

### Falsy Values in JavaScript

```js
false
0
""
null
undefined
NaN
```

Everything else is **truthy**.

---

### Examples

```js
5 ? "She" : "He"     // She (truthy)
0 ? "She" : "He"     // He (falsy)
"" ? "She" : "He"    // He (falsy)
" " ? "She" : "He"   // She (truthy)
```

---

## 12. Using Non-Boolean Conditions

```js
null ? "Anurag" : "Singh"
```

✔ Output:

```
Singh
```

```js
"Hello" ? "Anurag" : "Singh"
```

✔ Output:

```
Anurag
```

---

## 13. Nested / Chained Ternary (Advanced)

```js
const result =
  condition1
    ? value1
    : condition2
      ? value2
      : value3;
```

Equivalent to:

```js
if (condition1) {
  result = value1;
} else if (condition2) {
  result = value2;
} else {
  result = value3;
}
```

⚠️ **Not recommended for beginners**
⚠️ Reduces readability
⚠️ Hard to debug

---

## 14. When to Use Ternary

### ✅ Use when:

* Simple condition
* Two outcomes
* Improves readability

### ❌ Avoid when:

* Multiple conditions
* Complex logic
* Nested ternary chains

---

## 15. Ternary vs If-Else

### If-Else

```js
if (age >= 18) {
  status = "Adult";
} else {
  status = "Minor";
}
```

### Ternary

```js
const status = age >= 18 ? "Adult" : "Minor";
```

✔ Same logic
✔ Cleaner
✔ Shorter

---

## 16. Key Takeaways

* Ternary is a short form of `if-else`
* Always returns a value
* Uses `?` and `:`
* Works with truthy and falsy values
* Widely used in production code
* Avoid overusing nested ternary

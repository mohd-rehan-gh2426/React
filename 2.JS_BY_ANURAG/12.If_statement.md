## **1. Basics: JavaScript code runs line by line**

* JavaScript executes code in **two phases**:

  1. **Memory Creation Phase**: Variables are created in memory but not yet assigned values.
  2. **Code Execution Phase**: Actual values are assigned, and code runs line by line.

**Example:**

```javascript
let username = "Akash";
let userAge = 28;

console.log(username); // prints "Akash"
console.log(userAge);  // prints 28
```

* If you change the value of `userAge` or `username`, the console output changes.

---

## **2. Making Decisions with `if`**

* `if` is used to **run code only if a certain condition is true**.
* Syntax:

```javascript
if (condition) {
    // code to run if condition is true
}
```

* Example:

```javascript
let userAge = 20;

if (userAge >= 18) {
    console.log("User is an adult");
}
```

* If `userAge < 18`, this code **will not run**.

---

### **3. Conditions using comparison operators**

* Comparison operators:

  * `>` : greater than
  * `<` : less than
  * `>=` : greater than or equal to
  * `<=` : less than or equal to
  * `==` : equality (loose, converts string to number if needed)
  * `===` : strict equality (no type conversion)

**Example:**

```javascript
let userAge = 18;

if (userAge >= 18 && userAge <= 24) {
    console.log("User is a college student");
}
```

* **Logical operators**:

  * `&&` → AND (both conditions must be true)
  * `||` → OR (either condition can be true)
  * `!` → NOT (negates the condition)

---

## **4. Single vs multiple lines in `if`**

* **Single line `if`:**

```javascript
if (userAge >= 18) console.log("Adult");
```

* **Multiple lines**: wrap them in `{}` (block)

```javascript
if (userAge >= 18) {
    console.log("Adult");
    console.log("Can vote");
}
```

* Without `{}`, only the first line executes.

---

## **5. Using `prompt()` to get input**

* `prompt()` opens a pop-up to get user input. Returns **strings**.

```javascript
let username = prompt("Enter your name:");
let userAge = prompt("Enter your age:");
```

* Example with default values if user cancels:

```javascript
let username = prompt("Enter your name:") || "ProCoder";
let userAge = +prompt("Enter your age:") || 22; // converts string to number
```

* `+` before a string converts it to a number.

  * `"29"` → `29`
  * `"abc"` → `NaN`
  * `null` → `0`

* Alternative: `parseInt()` (better for numbers)

```javascript
let userAge = parseInt(prompt("Enter your age:"));
```

> Note: `parseInt(null)` → NaN, so sometimes `+` is easier for default values.

## **6. Categorizing based on age**

We can make decisions for different user categories:

| Age Range | Category             | Message                    |
| --------- | -------------------- | -------------------------- |
| 0–4       | Kid                  | Playing                    |
| 5–17      | School Student       | Learning science and maths |
| 18–24     | College Student      | Learning computer science  |
| 25–45     | Working Professional | Web developer              |
| 46+       | Retired              | Reads newspaper            |

**Example:**

```javascript
let username = prompt("Enter your name:") || "ProCoder";
let userAge = +prompt("Enter your age:") || 22;

if(userAge >= 0 && userAge <= 4) {
    console.log(`${username} is a kid and he/she is playing.`);
} 
if(userAge >= 5 && userAge <= 17) {
    console.log(`${username} is a school student learning science and maths.`);
} 
if(userAge >= 18 && userAge <= 24) {
    console.log(`${username} is a college student learning computer science.`);
} 
if(userAge >= 25 && userAge <= 45) {
    console.log(`${username} is a working professional and he/she is a web developer.`);
} 
if(userAge > 45) {
    console.log(`${username} is retired and he/she reads newspaper.`);
}
```

## **7. Problem with multiple `if` statements**

* Every `if` is checked **even after a condition is true**.
* Example: If age = 7, JS still checks all other `if`s unnecessarily.
* **Optimization**: Use `else if`:

```javascript
if(userAge >= 0 && userAge <= 4) {
    console.log(`${username} is a kid`);
} else if(userAge >= 5 && userAge <= 17) {
    console.log(`${username} is a school student`);
} else if(userAge >= 18 && userAge <= 24) {
    console.log(`${username} is a college student`);
} else if(userAge >= 25 && userAge <= 45) {
    console.log(`${username} is a working professional`);
} else {
    console.log(`${username} is retired`);
}
```

* **Benefit:** JS stops checking once a condition is true.

---

## **8. Using template literals for strings**

* Template literals allow inserting variables directly:

```javascript
let username = "Anurag";
let userAge = 25;

console.log(`Name: ${username}, Age: ${userAge}`);
```

* Works great for dynamic messages based on input.

---

## **9. Handling gender for “he/she”**

* You can ask the user for gender:

```javascript
let gender = prompt("Enter your gender (male/female):").toLowerCase();

let pronoun = gender === "male" ? "he" : "she"; // ternary operator (shortcut for if)
console.log(`${username} is a kid and ${pronoun} is playing.`);
```

* We'll learn **ternary operators** in future videos, but it's basically a short if/else.

---

## **10. Debugging in JavaScript**

* `debugger` keyword or breakpoints in DevTools pause the code to inspect values.

```javascript
debugger; // code stops here
```

* You can see variable values, step line by line, and check which `if` executes.

---

## **11. Homework / Assignment ideas from the video**

1. Default values if the user cancels:

   ```javascript
   let username = prompt("Enter name:") || "ProCoder";
   let userAge = +prompt("Enter age:") || 22;
   ```
2. Add `else if` to avoid unnecessary checks.
3. Ask user gender and show “he/she” dynamically.
4. Optional: Take input for object prices and decide if it’s affordable.

---

## **12. Key Takeaways**

* `if` checks a condition and runs code **only if true**.
* Use `{}` to group multiple lines.
* Logical operators (`&&`, `||`) combine conditions.
* `prompt()` gets input as string → convert with `+` or `parseInt`.
* `else if` helps optimize multiple checks.
* Template literals make strings with variables easy: `${variable}`.
* Debugging helps understand code execution.

# 🔒 `Object.seal()` & `Object.freeze()` — Deep Explanation

This video answers **one big confusion** most JS learners have:

> ❓ *“If an object is declared with `const`, why can we still change it?”*

To understand `Object.seal()` and `Object.freeze()`, we **must first understand how `const` actually works with objects**.

---

## 1️⃣ Why `const` Objects Can Still Change

### Example

```js
const user = {
  firstName: "Adarsh",
  age: 22
};
```

Now try:

```js
user.mobileNumber = 1234567890;
```

✅ **This works!**
But why?

### 🔑 Key Concept

`const` **does NOT freeze the value**
It only prevents **reassignment of the variable**

* ❌ You cannot do:

```js
user = {};
```

* ✅ But you *can*:

```js
user.age = 23;
user.city = "Bangalore";
```

### Why?

Because:

* `user` stores an **address**
* Modifying properties **does not change the address**
* Reassigning (`user = {}`) **changes the address**, which `const` blocks

---

## 2️⃣ How Primitive vs Object Update Works

### Primitive (string, number, boolean)

```js
let username = "Anurag";
username = "Rahul";
```

📌 What happens internally:

* New string `"Rahul"` is created
* Variable now points to a **new address**

👉 Address changes → reassignment → `const` blocks it

---

### Object (non-primitive)

```js
user.age = 30;
```

📌 What happens internally:

* Same object
* Same address
* Only internal structure changes

👉 Address stays same → `const` allows it

---

## 3️⃣ Deleting Object Properties (`delete`)

To **remove a key/property** from an object:

```js
delete user.firstName;
```

* Returns `true` (usually)
* Property is permanently removed

### Example

```js
delete user.address;
```

🚨 This removes the **entire nested object**

---

## 4️⃣ Why Do We Need Protection?

Without protection:

* Anyone can add properties
* Anyone can delete data
* Anyone can overwrite values

This is dangerous in:

* Config objects
* API responses
* State objects
* Large applications

So JavaScript gives us **two protection levels** 👇

---

# 🔐 `Object.seal()`

### What it does

```js
Object.seal(user);
```

### Effects

| Operation             | Allowed? |
| --------------------- | -------- |
| Add new property      | ❌ No     |
| Delete property       | ❌ No     |
| Modify existing value | ✅ Yes    |

---

### Example

```js
Object.seal(user);

user.mobile = 999;        // ❌ won't be added
delete user.age;          // ❌ false
user.age = 25;            // ✅ works
```

📌 Object shape becomes **fixed**, values can change.

---

## 5️⃣ `Object.freeze()` (Stricter)

### What it does

```js
Object.freeze(user);
```

### Effects

| Operation       | Allowed? |
| --------------- | -------- |
| Add property    | ❌ No     |
| Delete property | ❌ No     |
| Modify property | ❌ No     |

---

### Example

```js
Object.freeze(user);

user.age = 30;           // ❌ ignored
user.city = "Delhi";     // ❌ ignored
delete user.firstName;   // ❌ false
```

📌 Object becomes **completely immutable**

---

## 6️⃣ `Object.seal()` vs `Object.freeze()`

| Feature       | `seal`             | `freeze`       |
| ------------- | ------------------ | -------------- |
| Add new keys  | ❌                  | ❌              |
| Delete keys   | ❌                  | ❌              |
| Modify values | ✅                  | ❌              |
| Use case      | Controlled updates | Read-only data |

---

## 7️⃣ Important: Shallow Freeze ⚠️

```js
const user = {
  name: "Adarsh",
  address: {
    city: "Bangalore"
  }
};

Object.freeze(user);
user.address.city = "Delhi"; // ✅ STILL WORKS
```

❗ `freeze()` is **shallow**

* Nested objects are NOT frozen
* Each level must be frozen separately

---

## 8️⃣ Checking Property Existence — `in` Keyword

### Syntax

```js
"key" in object
```

### Example

```js
"firstName" in user     // true
"mobile" in user        // false
```

📌 Notes:

* Checks **only key existence**
* Does NOT care about value
* Even `null` or `undefined` still returns `true`

```js
user.age = undefined;
"age" in user   // true
```

---

## 9️⃣ Real-World Use Cases

### Use `Object.seal()` when:

* Object structure must remain same
* Values need updates
* Example: form data, user profile

### Use `Object.freeze()` when:

* Data must never change
* Example:

  * Config files
  * Constants
  * API schemas
  * App permissions

---

## 🔚 Final Mental Model

* `const` → protects **address**
* `seal()` → protects **structure**
* `freeze()` → protects **everything**
* `delete` → removes keys
* `in` → checks key existence

# JavaScript – First Program & Basics

This document contains **complete beginner-friendly notes** based on an introductory JavaScript lesson. It explains what programming is, how JavaScript runs in the browser, how to write your first program, and how the console works.

---

## 1. What is Programming?

Programming means:

> Writing step-by-step instructions so that a computer can perform tasks.

Computers understand only **binary (0 and 1)**. Programming languages act as a bridge between humans and machines.

### JavaScript Case

* Earlier: JavaScript was **interpreted**
* Now: Uses **JIT (Just-In-Time) Compilation**
* Modern JS engines convert code to machine-level instructions automatically

You write JavaScript in simple, English-like syntax. The engine handles everything internally.

---

## 2. JavaScript as a Programming Language

JavaScript is a programming language like:

* C
* C++
* Java
* Python

### Key Difference

* JavaScript runs **inside the browser**
* No extra installation required

Your browser acts as the **JavaScript runtime environment**.

---

## 3. Project Structure

Typical folder structure for a JavaScript project:

```
JavaScript/
 └── hello-world/
     ├── index.html
     └── script.js
```

---

## 4. Why HTML is Required?

JavaScript does not run alone in the browser.

Browsers understand:

* HTML (structure)
* CSS (style)
* JavaScript (logic)

Therefore, JavaScript must be **linked to an HTML file**.

---

## 5. Linking JavaScript with HTML

Inside `index.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>JS First Program</title>
  <script src="script.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
```

### How This Works

* Browser reads HTML line by line
* When it encounters `<script src="script.js">`
* Browser requests the JS file from the server
* JavaScript code is executed

---

## 6. JavaScript Output Location

JavaScript output appears in the **Browser Console**.

### How to Open Console

* Right click → Inspect
* Open **Console tab**

---

## 7. First JavaScript Program

Inside `script.js`:

```js
console.log('Hello World');
```

### `console.log()`

* Prints output to the browser console
* Similar to:

  * `printf()` in C
  * `cout` in C++
  * `print()` in Python

---

## 8. Console & REPL

The browser console works as a **REPL**:

* **R**ead
* **E**valuate
* **P**rint
* **L**oop

Example:

```js
5 + 6
```

Console reads the input, evaluates it, prints the result, and waits for the next command.

---

## 9. Console vs JavaScript File

### In Console

```js
5 + 6
```

✔ Output shown automatically

### In JavaScript File

```js
5 + 6
```

❌ No output

You must explicitly print:

```js
console.log(5 + 6);
```

---

## 10. Printing Strings and Numbers

### String (Text)

```js
console.log('Namaste World');
```

Strings require quotes.

### Number

```js
console.log(56);
```

Numbers do not use quotes.

---

## 11. Basic Math Operations

JavaScript supports standard arithmetic operators:

* `+` Addition
* `-` Subtraction
* `*` Multiplication
* `/` Division

Example:

```js
console.log(5 + 6 - 4 * 5 / 2);
```

---

## 12. Operator Precedence

JavaScript follows this order:

1. Brackets `()`
2. Multiplication `*` and Division `/` (left to right)
3. Addition `+` and Subtraction `-` (left to right)

### Example

```js
8 - 5 + 6
```

Result: `9`

### Using Brackets

```js
8 - (5 + 6)
```

Result: `-3`

---

## 13. Comments in JavaScript

### Single-line Comment

```js
// This is a comment
```

### Shortcut

* `Ctrl + /`

Comments are ignored by JavaScript and used for explanation.

---

## 14. Browser DevTools – Sources Tab

The **Sources tab** shows:

* Loaded HTML files
* Linked JavaScript files

Console output includes file name and line number:

```
script.js:4
```

This helps in debugging.

---

## 15. Multiple JavaScript Files

You can create multiple JS files:

* `script.js`
* `app.js`
* `main.js`

Rule:

* File must end with `.js`
* Must be linked in HTML if used

---

## 16. JavaScript Inside HTML (Not Recommended)

```html
<script>
  console.log(5 + 6);
</script>
```

This works but is **not good practice**.

Best practice:

* Keep JavaScript in separate `.js` files

---

## 17. `defer` Attribute (Introduction)

```html
<script src="script.js" defer></script>
```

* Tells browser to load HTML first
* Executes JavaScript after HTML is parsed
* Useful when JS interacts with HTML elements

---

## 18. Summary

You learned:

* What programming is
* How JavaScript runs in the browser
* How to connect JS with HTML
* What `console.log()` does
* What REPL means
* Difference between console and JS file
* Basic math and operator precedence
* Comments and debugging basics

This is your **first strong step into JavaScript programming** 🚀
